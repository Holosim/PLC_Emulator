# Systems Engineer — memory

## RTVM conventions

<!-- ID scheme (e.g. RTVM-<product-prefix>-###), category tags in use,
     and the verification-method vocabulary (test, analysis,
     demonstration, inspection). -->

- [RTVM conventions — PLC_Emulator](rtvm_conventions_plc_emulator.md) — default skeleton categories (UI/DATA-IN/CORE/DATA-OUT/OUT/NFR/DELIV) reused as-is; category meanings as applied to this project.

## Cross-product interface standards

<!-- Contracts shared across product lines — e.g. a common sensor-polling
     interface, a shared audio-latency budget, a common telemetry
     schema — so the same interface doesn't get redefined per product. -->

## Requirements patterns and traps

<!-- Requirement types that tend to get written ambiguously, and the
     phrasing that's proven to tighten them up. -->

- [PLC domain requirements traps](requirements_traps_plc_domain.md) — resolve standard domain-implementation gaps (e.g. missing companion instructions) yourself and document as an assumption; don't escalate those as scope ambiguity.

## Documentation index

<!-- Where the current SDD, interface docs, and test procedures live for
     each active product line (VR HMD, gesture-tracking gloves, video
     jukebox controller). -->

- PLC_Emulator: `docs/RTVM.md` populated & Approved (issue #2, closed). SDD next in issue #3.
