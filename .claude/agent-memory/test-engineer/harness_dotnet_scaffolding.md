The PLC_Emulator repo (`PlcEmulator.sln`) is a .NET 8 solution (pinned via
`global.json`, SDK 8.0.100, `rollForward: latestFeature`) with one
SDK-style `.csproj` per namespace root under `src/` (`.Config`, `.Core`,
`.Drivers`, `.Network`, `.Host`) plus `tests/PlcEmulator.Tests` (MSTest).

**How to verify a build/test pass from scratch:**
```
find . -name bin -o -name obj | xargs rm -rf
dotnet build PlcEmulator.sln
dotnet test PlcEmulator.sln
```
Expect 0 warnings/0 errors on build; test count grows as features land
(was 1/1 — a scaffolding smoke test — as of issue #5; 11/11 as of issue #7,
RTVM-DATA-IN-102 — 1 scaffolding smoke test + 10 new `ConfigLoaderNetworkTests`
covering NETWORK JSON parsing). Use the last recorded total as the
regression baseline: if it drops on a later run, that's a signal even if
the new feature's own tests pass.

**SDD dependency direction to check on every scaffolding-adjacent
issue** (grep `ProjectReference` in each `src/*/*.csproj`): `Config` is
a leaf; `Core → Config`; `Drivers → Core, Config`; `Network → Core`;
`Host → all four`. `Core` must never reference `Network` or `Drivers`.
`IDriver` lives in `src/PlcEmulator.Core/Drivers/IDriver.cs` (namespace
`PlcEmulator.Core.Drivers`) — interface next to its consumer
(`PlcController`/`TagTable`), not in `PlcEmulator.Drivers` — this was
an explicit, confirmed architecture decision (see issue #5 thread), not
a mistake to flag.

**NFR-502 (no third-party NuGet in src/):** `grep -rn PackageReference
src/*/*.csproj` should return nothing; only `tests/PlcEmulator.Tests`
should reference MSTest/coverlet packages.

**Why:** Windows/Visual Studio verification (NFR-501, DELIV-900) is a
one-time, late-stage consolidation step per client decision recorded on
issue #5 — not a per-feature CI matrix. `docs/ci/windows-verification.yml`
and `docs/ci/build-and-test.yml` are meant to stay staged, undeployed,
under `docs/ci/` (not copied into `.github/workflows/`) for the
duration of feature development. If a future issue's test procedure
seems to call for Windows-runner verification before the late-stage
consolidation issues (Implementation Plan #24/#27), that's a red flag —
check `docs/RTVM.md` TP-501/TP-900 wording first before assuming it's
required now.

**How to apply:** Use this checklist for any issue that touches
scaffolding, adds a new `src/*` project, or changes project references —
not just issue #5 itself.
