# Requirements Traceability & Verification Matrix (RTVM)

<!--

rules this document participates in.

## ID scheme

The category blocks below are a starting point — adjust them to fit
the project, not a fixed requirement:

| Category | Prefix | Range |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UI | UI | 001–099 |
| Data in | DATA-IN | 100–199 |
| Core algorithm / processing | CORE | 200–299 |
| Data out | DATA-OUT | 300–399 |
| Output | OUT | 400–499 |
| Non-functional | NFR | 500–599 |
| Deliverable | DELIV | 900–999 |

Companion schemes: `SN-<n>` for stakeholder needs (defined in
`docs/PROJECT_DEFINITION.md`), `TP-<nnn>` for test procedures.

## Verification vocabulary

Test / Demonstration / Analysis / Inspection. `DELIV` items are
typically verified by inspection and specified in `docs/SDD.md`'s
build/toolchain conventions rather than by a runtime test.

## Status vocabulary

Draft → Approved → In Implementation → In Test → Verified, plus
Blocked / Withdrawn.

## Requirements

| Req ID | Requirement | Stakeholder Need(s) | Verification Method | Status | Commit(s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | | | | | |

## Test Procedures

<!-- TP-<nnn>, one per verifiable requirement, with concrete test
     input values and expected output — not just "it works." -->
